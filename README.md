# MSDA Capstone Final
Capstone Project for the Master of Science in Data Analytics

The aim of this project is the development of a computer vision algorithm that can correctly classify a given histology image into one of 27 given classes. Focuses of this project include:
Using both Tile Level and Slide Level images:
1) Comparison of de novo neural network architectures, naiÌˆve Google Inception v3 architecture, and pre-trained Google Inception v3; the latter will involve reimplementation of the output layer of the network
Using only Slide Level images:
2) Accurate Classification of DX and PM sections for a given tumor type
3) DifferentiationbetweenDXandPMsectionsfortumortypesotherthantheonesusedfortraining
(generalizability)
Using both Slide Level and Tile Level images:
4) Differentiation between tumor types that are known to look similar to humans. For example:
a. Lung Adenocarcinoma vs. Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
b. Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma vs. Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma c. Glioblastoma multiforme vs. Brain Lower Grade Glioma
